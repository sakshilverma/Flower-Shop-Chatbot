# Flower-Shop-Chatbot

A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation through text chats or voice commands or both. Chatbot, short for chatterbot, is an artificial intelligence (AI) feature that can be embedded and used through any website or any messaging application.

I have built a prototype Flower Shop Chatbot - **'Freesia'** using IBM Watson Assistant (formerly Conversation). Watson Assistant is a truly remarkable piece of technology that will allow anyone, not just programmers, to build smart chatbots and conversational interfaces.

With this Chatbot you can -
* Take information about hours of operation of various stores in our Flower shop chain.
* Take information about our stores location, like address.
* Take Flower recommendations for your loved ones, or for various occasions like birthdays, marriages, mother’s day, valentine’s day, etc.
* Ask about our contact	details.
* Greet it by thanking it or saying a good bye when you are done conversing with it. 

You can visit and chat with my Chatbot on the below mentioned links -
